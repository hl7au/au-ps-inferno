    :definition: Information about a patient's relevant allergies or intolerances,
      describing the kind of reaction (e.g. rash, anaphylaxis, etc.); preferably the

      allergy. At a minimum, this section will list currently active and any relevant
      historical allergies and adverse reactions. If no information about allergies
      is available, or if no allergies are known this is to be clearly documented
      in this section.

      medications considered relevant by the authoring GP;  - the patient prescriptions
      or dispensations automatically extracted by a regional or a national EHR.  In
      those cases medications are documented in the Patient Summary as medication
      statements or medication requests. This section requires either an entry indicating
      the subject is known not to be on any relevant medication; either an entry indicating
      that no information is available about medications; or entries summarising the
      subject's relevant medications."
